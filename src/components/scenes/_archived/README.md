# Archived Scenes

These scenes were removed from the active codebase and archived here for safekeeping.

- DebugMapScene.jsx — used to debug building positions during development
- InspectorScene.jsx — map inspector to inspect nodes and materials
- BaseInspectorScene.jsx — inspector for the base map
- NewMapScene/* — older scene components (NewMap, Player, PlayerUI)

These files are preserved in case we want to restore or inspect them later. They are not imported by `src/App.jsx` and won't be included in production bundles unless re-imported.
